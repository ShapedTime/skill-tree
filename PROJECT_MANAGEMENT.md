2. What's in progress
3. Any blockers or dependencies
4. Help needed from other team members

## 📈 Success Metrics for Week 1-2

- [ ] All team members can run the application locally
- [ ] Database is accessible and migrations work
- [ ] User can register and log in
- [ ] Basic project structure is established
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline foundation is ready

## 🔄 Workflow Process

1. **Task Assignment**: PM assigns tasks via GitHub issues
2. **Development**: Agents work on assigned tasks
3. **Code Review**: Cross-review between agents
4. **Testing**: Product Owner validates features
5. **Merge**: PM approves and merges PRs

## ⚠️ Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Complex Docker setup delays | High | Medium | Start with minimal config, iterate |
| Authentication complexity | Medium | Low | Use established patterns |
| Agent coordination issues | Medium | Medium | Clear task boundaries |
