## 🚨 Current Blockers & Risks

### Active Blockers
1. **CRITICAL**: Technology stack decisions needed (#9)
   - Impact: Blocks all development tasks
   - Owner: Product Owner approval needed
   - Actions: Review and approve technology choices immediately

### Identified Risks
1. **High**: Missing Go microservices architecture (#12)
   - Impact: Backend services not properly planned
   - Mitigation: Design phase scheduled for Sprint 1

2. **Medium**: Agent coordination complexity
   - Impact: Multiple Claude Code agents need clear task division
   - Mitigation: Enhanced attribution system in place

3. **Medium**: Authentication complexity 
   - Impact: Security requirements may extend timeline
   - Mitigation: Phased approach (basic → enhanced security)

## 📋 Next Actions (Immediate)

### Today's Priority
1. **URGENT**: Product Owner review technology stack (#9) - **BLOCKING ALL DEVELOPMENT**
2. Software Architect complete Node.js engineer agent setup (#17)
3. Create project board for visual tracking

### This Week's Focus
1. Finalize all architecture decisions
2. Complete development environment setup
3. Begin parallel frontend/backend initialization
4. Establish team workflows and communication

## 📊 Sprint Metrics

### Velocity Tracking
- **Planned Capacity**: ~100 hours across team
- **Committed Work**: 42-58 hours (7 tasks)
- **Completed**: 0 hours (0%)
- **Risk Level**: 🔴 High (too early to assess)

### Team Capacity
| Role | Availability | Current Load | Status |
|------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| Product Owner | 20% | Decision review | Available |
| Project Manager | 100% | Sprint management | Active |
| Software Architect | 100% | Architecture + Setup | Busy |
| UI/UX Developer | 100% | Frontend development | Waiting |
| Software Engineer | 100% | Backend development | Waiting |

## 🎯 Sprint Success Criteria

### Definition of Done (Sprint Level)
