## 💡 Root Cause Analysis

### Why are we blocked?
1. **Over-planning**: Too much architecture discussion, not enough coding
2. **Analysis paralysis**: Perfect being enemy of good
3. **Sequential thinking**: Not starting until everything is "ready"

### Immediate Corrections
1. **Just Start**: Create files even if imperfect
2. **Parallel Work**: Multiple agents work simultaneously  
3. **Iterate Fast**: Ship "Hello World" then improve
4. **Daily Commits**: Something pushed every day

## 📊 Success Criteria for Today

### Minimum Viable Progress
- [ ] All setup files created and in repo
- [ ] `npm install` works in both projects
- [ ] `docker-compose up` starts containers
- [ ] React shows something in browser
- [ ] API responds to health check
- [ ] All agents unblocked

### End of Day Checkpoint (20:00 UTC)
If these are not complete:
- Escalate to Product Owner
- Schedule weekend emergency session
- Consider sprint scope reduction

## 🔄 Next Status Update
**When**: Today 17:00 UTC  
**Focus**: Verify setup completion and unblocking  
**Action**: Update all issue statuses

## 📝 Team Assignments

| Role | Current Focus | Next Task | Blocked? |
|------|---------------|-----------|----------|
| Software Architect | #27 Setup files | #30 Docker | No - **DO NOW** |
| UI/UX Developer | Waiting | #6 React | Yes - needs #27 |
| Software Engineer | Waiting | #7 Node.js | Yes - needs #27 |
| Project Manager | Escalation | Dashboard updates | No |

## 💭 Lessons for Immediate Application

1. **Ship something TODAY** - Even if it's just package.json files
2. **Unblock aggressively** - Don't wait for perfect solutions
3. **Parallel execution** - All agents work simultaneously once unblocked
4. **Bias for action** - Do first, refine later

## 🔴 ESCALATION NOTICE

**To: Product Owner (Teymur)**  
**From: Project Manager**  
**Subject: Sprint at Critical Risk**

We are 43% through the sprint with 0% progress. Issue #27 is blocking all work. I have provided exact file contents in the issue. If not resolved by end of day, we need emergency intervention.

**Recommended Actions**:
1. Direct implementation of provided files
2. All hands on deck for next 48 hours
3. Scope reduction discussion if needed
