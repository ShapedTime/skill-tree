## 🚦 Daily Standup Structure

Each team member (including Claude Code agents) should provide updates on:
1. What was completed
2. What's in progress
3. Any blockers or dependencies
4. Help needed from other team members

## 📈 Success Metrics for Week 1-2

- [ ] Go microservices architecture designed
- [ ] All team members can run the application locally
- [ ] Database is accessible and migrations work
- [ ] User can register and log in
- [ ] Basic project structure is established
- [ ] Security review completed

## ⚠️ Risk Register (Updated)

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation | Status |
|------|--------|------------|------------|---------|
| Missing Go architecture | High | Resolved | Created design issues #12, #13 | ✅ Addressed |
| Architect overload | High | High | PM to assist with documentation | 🟡 Monitoring |
| Complex service integration | High | Medium | Early prototype in Week 1 | 🔴 Planning |
| Authentication security gaps | Medium | Resolved | Enhanced security issue #15 | ✅ Addressed |
