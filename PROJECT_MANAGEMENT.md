## 📋 Current Task Status

### 🔴 Critical Path Tasks (Must Complete)
| Issue | Title | Assignee | Status | Notes |
|-------|-------|----------|--------|-------|
| #27 | Basic Technology Stack Setup | Software Architect | 🔴 Not Started | **BLOCKER** - Simple package.json and Docker setup needed |
| #6 | Basic React Frontend Setup | UI/UX Developer | 🔴 Not Started | Blocked by #27 |
| #7 | Basic Node.js Backend Setup | Software Engineer | 🔴 Not Started | Blocked by #27 |
| #5 | Authentication Flow | Engineer + UI/UX | 🔴 Not Started | Blocked by #6, #7 |
| #38 | Full Stack Integration Test | Engineer + UI/UX | 🔴 Not Started | Final validation |

### 🟡 High Priority (Support Tasks)

## 🚨 Current Blockers & Actions

### Critical Blocker
**Issue #27 - Technology Stack Setup**
- **Impact**: Blocks ALL development work
- **Required Action**: Create basic package.json files and Docker setup TODAY
- **Owner**: Software Architect
- **Resolution Target**: End of Day

### Risk Assessment
| Risk | Level | Mitigation |
|------|-------|------------|
| No code written after 6 days | 🔴 High | Focus on simple working code, not perfection |
| Over-engineering tendency | 🟡 Medium | Archived complex features, enforce YAGNI principle |
| Time pressure (8 days left) | 🟡 Medium | Parallel work once setup complete |

## 🎯 Today's Priorities (September 19)

### MUST DO TODAY
1. **#27**: Create package.json files with basic dependencies
2. **#30**: Create simple docker-compose.yml
3. **#6**: Start React app with "Hello World"
4. **#7**: Start Node.js API with health endpoint

### Goal for End of Day
- ✅ Can run `npm install` in both frontend and backend
- ✅ Can run `docker-compose up` for database
- ✅ React app shows "Hello World" on localhost:3000
- ✅ API responds to GET /health on localhost:8000

## 📊 Simplified MVP Requirements

### What We're Building (Keep It Simple)
```
Frontend (React):
- Home page
- Login/Register forms
- Basic dashboard
- Simple API calls

Backend (Node.js):
- /health endpoint
- /auth/register
- /auth/login
- JWT generation

Database:
- Users table
- Basic auth fields
```

### What We're NOT Building (Yet)
- ❌ Complex microservices
- ❌ Advanced security features
- ❌ Performance optimizations
- ❌ Complex visualizations
- ❌ Multiple authentication methods

## 📈 Sprint Metrics

### Time Analysis
- **Sprint Duration**: 14 days
- **Days Elapsed**: 6 (43%)
- **Code Written**: 0 lines
- **Issues Completed**: 0 functional tasks
- **Velocity**: ⚠️ Behind schedule

### Burndown Status

## 🔄 Next 48 Hours Plan

### Thursday, Sept 19 (Today)
- Morning: Complete basic setup (#27, #30)
- Afternoon: Start frontend (#6) and backend (#7)
- Evening: Verify everything runs

### Friday, Sept 20
- Morning: Complete auth endpoints (#5 backend)
- Afternoon: Complete auth UI (#5 frontend)
- Evening: Test auth flow

### Weekend Sprint
- Saturday: Integration testing (#38)
- Sunday: Documentation and cleanup

## 📊 Success Criteria for Sprint

### Minimum Viable Success (Must Have)
- ✅ Docker environment runs
- ✅ Frontend loads in browser
- ✅ Backend responds to requests
- ✅ User can register
- ✅ User can login
- ✅ JWT tokens work

### Nice to Have (If Time Permits)
- Protected routes
- Error handling
- Basic styling
- Comprehensive tests

## 🎬 Action Items

### Immediate (Next 2 Hours)
1. **Software Architect**: Create package.json and Docker files
2. **UI/UX Developer**: Set up React project
3. **Software Engineer**: Set up Node.js project
4. **Project Manager**: Update this dashboard with progress

### End of Day Checkpoint
- [ ] All setup files created and committed
- [ ] All team members can run the project
- [ ] Basic "Hello World" working
- [ ] Plan for tomorrow confirmed

## 📊 Team Status

| Role | Current Task | Blocker | Next Task |
|------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| Software Architect | #27 Setup | None | #30 Docker |
| UI/UX Developer | Waiting | #27 | #6 React |
| Software Engineer | Waiting | #27 | #7 Node.js |
| Project Manager | Dashboard update | None | #31 Docs |

## 🚦 Project Health: 🔴 CRITICAL

**Reasons**:
- No functional code after 6 days
- 57% of sprint time remaining
- All tasks blocked by setup

**Recovery Plan**:
- Complete setup TODAY
- Parallel development tomorrow
- Weekend sprint if needed
- Focus on working code over perfect code

## 📝 Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong
- Started with over-engineered approach
- Too much planning, not enough doing
- Created complex issues before basics

### Corrections Made
- Archived 13 over-complex issues
- Simplified all remaining tasks
- Focus on "Hello World" first
- YAGNI principle enforced

### Going Forward
- Start simple, iterate
- Working code > perfect architecture
- Daily commits required
- Bias toward action
