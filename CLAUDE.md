## Git & GitHub Standards

### Branch Naming
- `feature/[issue#]-description` - New features
- `bugfix/[issue#]-description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/[issue#]-description` - Documentation
- `refactor/[issue#]-description` - Code refactoring
- `test/[issue#]-description` - Test additions

### Commit Format
```
type: Brief description

[Icon] [Role] Implementation
Details here
References #[issue]

Co-authored-by: [Role] <[email]>
```

### Commit Types
- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Tests
- `chore:` Maintenance

## Critical Rules

1. **NEVER merge PRs** - Only Product Owner (Teymur) merges
2. **ALWAYS use attribution** - Co-author in commits, role prefix in comments
3. **UPDATE issues regularly** - Daily progress comments
4. **TEST before pushing** - No broken code in PRs
5. **REFERENCE issue numbers** - In commits and PRs

## Common Git Commands

```bash
# Start work
git checkout master && git pull
git checkout -b feature/[issue#]-name

# Save work
git add . && git commit -m "message"
git push -u origin [branch-name]

# Update branch
git fetch origin master
git rebase origin/master

# Check status
git status
git log --oneline -5

# Fix mistakes
git reset --soft HEAD~1  # Undo last commit, keep changes
git stash                 # Save work temporarily
git stash pop            # Restore saved work
```

## Architecture

The codebase is organized into specialized directories reflecting the agent-driven workflow:

```
projects/                 # Main application projects
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ web-app/             # React PWA frontend
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api-gateway/         # Node.js API gateway
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ai-service/          # Go-based AI/LLM service

shared/                   # Cross-project resources
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/                # Shared documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ schemas/             # API schemas and data models
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/              # Shared images, icons, etc.

workflows/               # Agent workflow definitions
sprints/                # Sprint-specific contexts and artifacts
infrastructure/         # DevOps and deployment configurations
```

## Key Documents

- `/docs/PM_GUIDELINES.md` - Detailed PM processes and team standards
- `/SkillTree - Project Brief v2.0.md` - Complete project specification
- `/PROJECT_MANAGEMENT.md` - Current sprint status and progress
- GitHub Issues - Task assignments and requirements

## Development Notes

- This is an early-stage project with directory structure established but minimal implementation
- The agent-driven workflow is the primary development paradigm
- When working on this codebase, consider which agent role your changes align with
- Cross-agent coordination happens through GitHub issues and shared documentation
- Persistent context maintained per sprint in sprints/ directory
- Documentation both created and consumed by agents

## Your First Task

1. Check GitHub issues assigned to your role
2. Look for issues with your role prefix (e.g., `üîß [ENGINEER]`)
3. Follow the workflow above to complete the task
4. Ask for clarification if anything is unclear

Remember: You're part of a professional development team. Maintain high standards, communicate clearly, and deliver quality work.
