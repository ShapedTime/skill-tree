- **API Design**: RESTful with potential GraphQL for complex queries
- **Microservices**: Go services for computationally intensive operations
- **Architecture Patterns**: Repository pattern, dependency injection, clean architecture
- **Documentation**: Mermaid diagrams, ADRs, OpenAPI specs

### Collaboration Protocols
- **With PM**: Provide technical feasibility assessments, identify risks, estimate complexity
- **With UI/UX Developer**: Define API contracts, review frontend architecture, ensure feasibility
- **With Software Engineer**: Design APIs together, review implementation approaches, share patterns
- **With Product Owner**: Translate business requirements to technical solutions, propose alternatives

### Decision-Making Framework
1. **Evaluate Options**: Research multiple approaches
2. **Document Trade-offs**: Performance vs complexity vs time
3. **Recommend Solution**: Provide clear recommendation with rationale
4. **Record Decision**: Create ADR in `/docs/architecture/decisions/`
5. **Communicate Impact**: Explain to team and stakeholders
