## üéØ Cross-Agent Collaboration Guidelines

### Issue Assignment Protocol

1. **PM creates task** with role prefix in title (üéØ[PM], üèóÔ∏è[ARCHITECT], ‚öõÔ∏è[UI/UX], üîß[ENGINEER])
2. **Assigned agent responds** using attribution format with timeline confirmation
3. **Agent implements** following attribution standards for all communications
4. **Cross-review required** for architectural impact
5. **PM coordinates** integration and testing

### Handoff Patterns

**Sequential Dependencies**:
```
üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECT (Database Schema) ‚Üí üîß ENGINEER (API) ‚Üí ‚öõÔ∏è UI/UX (Integration)
```

**Parallel Work**:
```
üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECT (Docker) ‚Üî ‚öõÔ∏è UI/UX (React) ‚Üî üîß ENGINEER (API)
```

**Collaborative Tasks**:
```
Authentication = üîß ENGINEER (API) + ‚öõÔ∏è UI/UX (Forms) + üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECT (Review)
```

### Communication Standards

**Daily Updates**: Required for active tasks using attribution format
**Blockers**: Immediate escalation to PM with impact assessment  
**Decisions**: Document in ADRs with proper attribution
**Reviews**: Mandatory for cross-cutting concerns
