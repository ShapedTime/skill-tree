# ADR-001: Frontend Technology Stack Selection

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2025-09-13
**Decision Makers**: Software Architect, Product Owner
**Consulted**: Development Team
**Informed**: All Stakeholders

## Context

SkillTree is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that gamifies skill learning through videogame-like skill trees. The frontend needs to be:

- **Engaging**: As addictive as social media scrolling but productive
- **Performant**: Fast loading and smooth interactions on mobile/desktop
- **Modern**: PWA capabilities with offline support
- **Maintainable**: Type-safe codebase for long-term development
- **Visualizable**: Complex skill tree graph rendering capabilities

## Decision

We will use **Vite + React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS** for the frontend technology stack.

### Selected Technologies:

- **Build Tool**: Vite 5.x
- **Framework**: React 18.x with hooks and functional components
- **Type System**: TypeScript 5.x in strict mode
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS 3.x with utility-first approach
- **State Management**: Zustand (lightweight, type-safe)
- **Bundling**: Vite's native ESBuild-based bundling

## Options Considered

### Build Tools
| Option | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|--------|------|------|----------|
| **Vite** ✅ | • Ultra-fast HMR<br>• Native ESM support<br>• Excellent TypeScript integration<br>• PWA plugin support | • Newer ecosystem<br>• Some legacy plugin compatibility | **SELECTED** |
| Create React App | • Well-established<br>• Large community<br>• Battle-tested | • Slower build times<br>• Webpack complexity<br>• Limited customization | Rejected |
| Next.js | • SSR/SSG capabilities<br>• Full-stack features<br>• Great performance | • Overkill for PWA<br>• Server complexity<br>• Learning curve | Rejected |

### Styling Solutions
| Option | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|--------|------|------|----------|
| **TailwindCSS** ✅ | • Utility-first efficiency<br>• Consistent design system<br>• Small bundle size<br>• Great TypeScript support | • Learning curve<br>• Class name verbosity | **SELECTED** |
| Styled Components | • CSS-in-JS benefits<br>• Dynamic styling<br>• Component scoping | • Runtime overhead<br>• Bundle size impact | Rejected |
| CSS Modules | • Scoped styling<br>• No runtime cost<br>• Standard CSS | • Verbose imports<br>• Limited dynamic styling | Rejected |

## Rationale

### Why Vite?
1. **Development Speed**: Sub-second HMR enables rapid iteration
2. **PWA Support**: Native PWA plugin with service worker generation
3. **TypeScript First**: Built-in TS support without configuration
4. **Modern Architecture**: ESM-native with better tree shaking
5. **Performance**: Significantly faster builds than CRA/Webpack

### Why React 18?
1. **Team Familiarity**: Established React expertise in team
2. **Ecosystem**: Largest component library and tooling ecosystem
3. **Concurrent Features**: Automatic batching and Suspense for better UX
4. **PWA Integration**: Excellent service worker and offline support
5. **Skill Tree Rendering**: Rich ecosystem for graph visualization

### Why TypeScript Strict Mode?
1. **Type Safety**: Critical for complex skill tree data structures
2. **Developer Experience**: Better IDE support and refactoring
3. **Code Quality**: Compile-time error catching reduces bugs
4. **Team Coordination**: Clear interfaces between components
5. **Long-term Maintenance**: Easier codebase evolution

### Why TailwindCSS?
1. **Rapid Development**: Utility-first approach speeds up styling
2. **Consistency**: Built-in design system prevents style drift
3. **Performance**: Purged CSS keeps bundle sizes minimal
4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first utilities built-in
5. **Dark Mode**: Native dark mode support for user preference

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Fast Development**: Vite's HMR enables rapid iteration cycles
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript prevents runtime errors in complex skill trees
- **Performance**: Small bundle sizes and fast loading times
- **PWA Ready**: Native PWA capabilities with offline support
- **Maintainable**: Clear component structure and type definitions
- **Modern DX**: Excellent developer experience with tooling

### Negative
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs TailwindCSS familiarity
- **Build Complexity**: Multiple build tools to configure and maintain
- **Dependency Management**: More dependencies to track and update

### Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk**: Vite ecosystem less mature than Webpack
  - **Mitigation**: Vite has reached stability and has strong community support
- **Risk**: TailwindCSS class bloat in components
  - **Mitigation**: Use component extraction and CSS utilities organization
- **Risk**: TypeScript configuration complexity
  - **Mitigation**: Start with strict mode and establish clear coding standards

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Week 1)
- [ ] Initialize Vite project with React + TypeScript template
- [ ] Configure TailwindCSS with design system tokens
- [ ] Set up ESLint/Prettier with TypeScript rules
- [ ] Configure PWA plugin with service worker
- [ ] Establish component library structure

### Phase 2: Development Tooling (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Configure Zustand store with TypeScript
- [ ] Set up React Router for SPA navigation
- [ ] Implement responsive design breakpoints
- [ ] Add development and production build scripts
- [ ] Configure environment variable management

### Phase 3: Testing Integration (Week 2)
- [ ] Integrate Vitest for unit testing
- [ ] Set up React Testing Library
- [ ] Configure component testing patterns
- [ ] Add test coverage reporting
- [ ] Establish CI/CD testing pipeline

## Compliance and Standards

- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled with comprehensive type coverage
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier with team-agreed rules
- **Testing**: >80% code coverage requirement
- **Performance**: Core Web Vitals targets for PWA optimization
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for inclusive design

## Future Considerations

- **React Concurrent Features**: Explore Suspense boundaries for skill tree loading
- **State Management Evolution**: Consider React Query for server state if API complexity grows
- **Component Library**: Evaluate headless UI libraries (Radix, Ariakit) for accessibility
- **Performance**: Monitor bundle size and consider code splitting strategies
- **PWA Enhancement**: Progressive enhancement for offline-first skill tree experience
