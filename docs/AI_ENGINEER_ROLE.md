# AI Engineer Role - AI Agent Orchestration Specialist

## Role Overview

The AI Engineer serves as the meta-level orchestration specialist, optimizing how the Product Owner and team work with AI agents. This role focuses on maximizing AI agent effectiveness through context engineering, workflow optimization, and team coordination patterns.

## Core Expertise Areas

### 1. AI Agent Workflow Optimization
- **Context Window Management**: Strategies for maintaining context across long sessions
- **Prompt Engineering**: Crafting effective prompts for different agent types
- **Handoff Protocols**: Smooth transitions between agents without context loss
- **Parallel Processing**: Coordinating multiple agents on independent tasks
- **Error Recovery**: Strategies when agents lose context or produce incorrect outputs

### 2. Context Engineering & Management

#### Context Hierarchy System
```
Level 1: Project Context (persistent)
├── Project Brief
├── Architecture Decisions
└── Team Guidelines

Level 2: Sprint Context (week-long)
├── Current Sprint Goals
├── Active Issues
└── Dependencies

Level 3: Task Context (session-specific)
├── Current Task Details
├── Related Code/Files
└── Recent Decisions
```

#### Context Preservation Strategies
- **Checkpoint Documents**: Regular state snapshots
- **Context Bridges**: Linking documents between sessions
- **Memory Artifacts**: Structured summaries for agent handoffs
- **Reference Anchors**: Key documents agents should always access

### 3. AI Agent Team Building

#### Agent Specialization Matrix

| Agent Type | Best For | Limitations | Context Needs |
|------------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Claude Opus 4.1 (Desktop) | Complex reasoning, Strategy, Architecture | No direct code execution | Full project context |
| Claude Code | Implementation, File operations, Testing | Limited to code context | Task-specific context |
| Specialized Agents | Domain expertise (DB, UI, API) | Narrow focus | Domain + task context |

#### Team Coordination Patterns

**Pattern 1: Sequential Pipeline**
```
PM (planning) → Architect (design) → Engineer (implement) → UI/UX (frontend)
```

**Pattern 2: Parallel Swarm**
```
        ┌→ UI/UX (components)
PM ─────┼→ Engineer (API)
        └→ Architect (infrastructure)
```

**Pattern 3: Review Cascade**
```
Engineer (implement) → Architect (review) → PM (approve) → Deploy
```

## Workflow Optimization Strategies

### 1. Context Loading Protocol

**Optimal Context Package Structure**:
```markdown
## Context Package for [Agent Role]
**Task**: [Specific task]
**Session ID**: [Unique identifier]

### Required Context
1. **Immediate**: [Current task details]
2. **Supporting**: [Related files/decisions]
3. **Reference**: [Background docs]

### Previous Work
- Last session outcome: [Summary]
- Pending decisions: [List]
- Known issues: [List]

### Expected Deliverables
- [ ] Deliverable 1
- [ ] Deliverable 2
```

### 2. Agent Handoff Template

```markdown
## Agent Handoff Document
**From**: [Agent A Role]
**To**: [Agent B Role]
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD

### Completed Work
- [What was accomplished]
- [Key decisions made]
- [Files modified/created]

### Context Transfer
- Critical information: [Details]
- Assumptions made: [List]
- Open questions: [List]

### Next Steps
1. [Specific action for Agent B]
2. [Expected outcome]

### Reference Files
- Main: [Primary files to review]
- Supporting: [Additional context]
```

### 3. Multi-Agent Orchestration

#### Effective Patterns

**1. Context Relay Race**
- Each agent adds to a cumulative context document
- No context resets between agents
- Progressive enhancement of solution

**2. Divide & Conquer**
- Break complex tasks into independent chunks
- Assign to parallel agents
- PM agent consolidates results

**3. Expert Council**
- Present problem to multiple agents
- Gather diverse perspectives
- Synthesize best approaches

### 4. Performance Optimization

#### Speed Improvements
- **Pre-loaded Templates**: Standard contexts ready to paste
- **Minimal Context**: Only essential information per task
- **Clear Boundaries**: Explicit start/end of agent responsibilities
- **Batch Operations**: Group similar tasks for single agent session

#### Quality Improvements
- **Verification Loops**: Built-in review steps
- **Test-Driven**: Clear acceptance criteria upfront
- **Documentation-First**: Agents document before implementing
- **Incremental Delivery**: Small, verifiable chunks

## Best Practices for AI Agent Management

### 1. Session Management

**DO**:
- Start each session with clear objective
- Provide session ID for tracking
- Summarize at session end
- Create handoff documents

**DON'T**:
- Assume agents remember previous sessions
- Overload initial context
- Skip verification steps
- Mix multiple complex tasks

### 2. Context Engineering

**Effective Context Principles**:
1. **Hierarchical**: Most important info first
2. **Relevant**: Only what's needed for task
3. **Structured**: Consistent format
4. **Referenced**: Link to source documents
5. **Versioned**: Track context evolution

### 3. Error Recovery

**When Agents Lose Context**:
1. Stop current task
2. Reload minimal context
3. Verify understanding
4. Resume from checkpoint
5. Document issue for prevention

**Common Context Loss Triggers**:
- Session too long (>50 messages)
- Too many file operations
- Complex state changes
- Ambiguous requirements

## Tool & Platform Optimization
