1. **User Authentication**: Secure registration, login, session management
2. **AI Tree Generation**: LLM integration for personalized skill trees
3. **Progress Tracking**: Node completion, XP calculation, streak tracking
4. **Tree Customization**: User modifications while maintaining data integrity
5. **Performance**: Fast, responsive APIs for seamless user experience

## Quality Standards & Guidelines

### Code Quality Requirements
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode, comprehensive types, no `any`
- **Security**: Input validation, SQL injection prevention, rate limiting
- **Testing**: Unit tests >80% coverage, integration tests, error scenarios
- **Documentation**: JSDoc, README files, API specifications
- **Performance**: Optimized queries, proper indexing, caching strategies

### API Design Principles
- **Versioning**: `/api/v1/` prefix for future compatibility
- **Consistency**: Standardized responses, error formats, naming conventions
- **REST Compliance**: Proper HTTP methods, status codes, resource design
- **Documentation**: Complete OpenAPI specs with examples
- **Security**: Authentication required, input validation, error handling

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks Identified
- **AI API Costs**: Implement caching, usage monitoring, optimization
- **Graph Algorithm Complexity**: Start simple, use proven libraries, optimize iteratively
- **Integration Challenges**: Clear API contracts, mock data, parallel development
- **Performance Requirements**: Database optimization, caching, monitoring

### Timeline Risk Mitigation
- **MVP Focus**: Prioritize core features, defer nice-to-have functionality
- **Parallel Development**: Enable frontend work through API mocking
- **Quality vs Speed**: Balanced approach focusing on critical paths
- **Technical Debt**: Document decisions, plan refactoring phases
