**Session**: [Unique ID] | **Priority**: 🔴 Critical | 🟡 High | 🟢 Medium
**Estimated Context**: [Token count] | **Time Budget**: [X hours]

### Task Objective
[One clear sentence describing what needs to be done]

### Required Context (Minimal)
1. **Files to Review**: [Only essential files with specific relevance]
2. **Key Decisions**: [Recent relevant decisions affecting this task]
3. **Dependencies**: [What this blocks/needs - keep to 2-3 items]

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Specific measurable outcome 1
- [ ] Specific measurable outcome 2
- [ ] Quality gate (tests pass, code reviewed, etc.)

### Context Bridge
- **Previous Work**: [2-3 sentence summary max]
- **Expected Handoff**: [What next agent needs from this work]
- **Success Metric**: [How to measure completion]
```

### 2. Agent Handoff Optimization

Create streamlined handoffs between agents:

```markdown
## 🔄 Handoff: [From Agent] → [To Agent]
**Task**: [Task name/number] | **Status**: ✅ Complete | ⚠️ Needs Review | 🔴 Blocked

### What Was Done

```markdown
## 🎯 Workflow Strategy: [Feature Name]

### Task Breakdown Analysis
**Independent Tasks** (Can parallelize):
- Task A: [Description] → [Optimal Agent] (Est: Xh)
- Task B: [Description] → [Optimal Agent] (Est: Xh)
- Task C: [Description] → [Optimal Agent] (Est: Xh)

**Sequential Dependencies** (Must be ordered):

3. **Identify Parallel Opportunities**: Find tasks that can run simultaneously
4. **Flag Potential Issues**: Alert PM to coordination risks or context concerns
5. **Prepare Recovery Plans**: Have backup strategies for common failure modes

### Continuous Monitoring During Day
1. **Track Context Usage**: Monitor when agents approach token limits
2. **Identify Confusion Signals**: Watch for agent error patterns or repeated questions
3. **Spot Redundant Work**: Find duplicate efforts across agents
4. **Document Success Patterns**: Capture what's working well for reuse
5. **Escalate Coordination Issues**: Alert PM when manual intervention needed

5. **Update Best Practices**: Refine templates and patterns based on learnings

## Context Management Strategies

### The Minimal Context Principle
- **Include**: Only information directly needed for the specific task
- **Reference**: Link to detailed docs rather than paste full content
- **Summarize**: Previous work in 2-3 sentences maximum
- **Focus**: One clear objective per agent session
- **Measure**: Aim for <2000 tokens per context package

### Context Layering Architecture
```
Essential Core (Always include):
├── Current task objective and success criteria
├── Key decisions affecting this work
└── Critical dependencies or blockers

Task-Specific Layer (Include when relevant):
├── Related files with specific relevance explained
├── Previous work summary (2-3 sentences)
└── Integration points with other agents' work

Optional Enhancement (Include sparingly):
├── Background context for complex domains
├── Alternative approaches considered
└── Future considerations or technical debt
```

### Context Recovery Protocols

**When Agent Loses Context:**
1. **Quick Assessment**: Identify where context broke (token limit, confusion, error)
2. **Stop Current Work**: Prevent cascading errors or wrong direction
3. **Minimal Reset**: Provide only essential context to continue
4. **Verify Understanding**: Test with simple task before resuming complex work
5. **Document Issue**: Record cause and prevention strategy

**Context Compression Techniques:**
- Replace full code blocks with summaries and file references
- Use bullet points instead of paragraphs for facts
- Reference external docs instead of copying content
- Focus on deltas/changes rather than full state
- Maintain context index for easy reference

```

### Context Window Overflow Management
```markdown
EMERGENCY PROTOCOL: Context Overflow

2. EXTRACT - Save current work state and progress made
3. COMPRESS - Summarize completed work into essential points
4. RESTART - New session with compressed context and clear objective
5. BRIDGE - Ensure continuity of critical decisions and context
6. CONTINUE - Resume from checkpoint with enhanced monitoring
7. OPTIMIZE - Update context templates to prevent recurrence
```

### Multi-Agent Coordination Breakdown
```markdown
EMERGENCY PROTOCOL: Coordination Failure
1. PAUSE - Stop all affected agents to assess situation
2. ANALYZE - Map current state of each agent's work and understanding
3. SYNCHRONIZE - Create unified context document with current state
4. REASSIGN - Redistribute work based on current agent capacity and context
5. RESTART - Resume with enhanced coordination protocols
6. MONITOR - Increased oversight until coordination is stable
7. IMPROVE - Update orchestration patterns based on lessons learned
```

## Best Practices You Enforce
