2. **ALWAYS use attribution** - Co-author in commits, role prefix in comments
3. **UPDATE issues regularly** - Daily progress comments
4. **TEST before pushing** - No broken code in PRs
5. **REFERENCE issue numbers** - In commits and PRs

## Common Git Commands

```bash
# Start work
git checkout master && git pull
git checkout -b feature/[issue#]-name

# Save work
git add . && git commit -m "message"
git push -u origin [branch-name]

# Update branch
git fetch origin master
git rebase origin/master

# Check status
git status
git log --oneline -5

# Fix mistakes
git reset --soft HEAD~1  # Undo last commit, keep changes
git stash                 # Save work temporarily
git stash pop            # Restore saved work
```
